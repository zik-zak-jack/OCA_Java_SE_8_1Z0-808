### Class

	A class is a design from which object is created.
	It is used to specify the attributes and behavior of an object.
	The attributes of an object are implemented using variables.
	The behavior is implemented using methods.

### Instance Variable

	Instance variables are used to store the state of an object.
	Each object has its own copy of instance variables.

### Static Variable
	
	Static variable is shared by all the objects of a class.

### Instance Method

	Instance Method are used to manipulate the instance variables.

### Static Method

	Static Method are used to manipulate the static variables.

### Constructor

	Constructor is used to create and initialize the objects of a class.
	A Class can define multiple constructors that accept different sets of method parameters


### Interface

* An interface specifies a contract for the classes to implement.
* Its a grouping of related methods and constants
* Methods can define default implementation. 
* If default implementation is not defined, Methods are implicitly abstract
* Interface can also define static methods
